## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize classic sorting algorithms. The visualizer helps beginners and enthusiasts gain a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms by seeing them in action.



**Overview**

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science, and understanding how they work is essential for programmers. This sorting visualizer provides a clear and interactive way to see each algorithmâ€™s step-by-step process, making learning more intuitive and engaging.
**Purpose**

The primary goal of this project is to:

1. Improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Offer an educational tool for beginners to visualize and understand sorting algorithms.
3. Demonstrate the efficiency and behavior of each sorting algorithm in a visually engaging way.

**Supported Sorting Algorithms**

This visualizer currently includes the following algorithms:

1.**Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm.

2.**Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time.

3.**Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the minimum element and places it at the beginning.

4.**Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits and merges sorted subarrays.

5.**Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts by partitioning elements.
